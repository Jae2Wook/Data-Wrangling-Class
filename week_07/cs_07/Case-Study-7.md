# implying to the salary
players$adj_salary <- 0
for (i in 1:nrow(players)) {
  players$adj_salary[i] = players$salary[i] / filter(values, values$year == players$yearID[i]) %>% pull(adj_value)
}
```


```r
coun <- data.frame(table(players$name_full))

#### Conclusion
Most of the MLB players from Utah schools were BYU. Compare to the other schools, most of the high salary players from BYU.
